#### 2. If the number of characters is less than 8 or greater than 128, the application will not generate a password. 
#### 3. The user is then asked for additional requirements which enhance the generated password. 
#### 4. The user is at liberty to add upper case, lower case, numeric and/or even special characters. The only condition is to add at least one of the four. 
#### 5. When all the requirements are validated a secure and randomly generated password is displayed.
